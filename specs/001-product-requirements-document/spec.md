# Feature Specification: ChatGPT Archive Utility

**Feature Branch**: `001-product-requirements-document`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Product Requirements Document ‚Äî ChatGPT Archive Utility"

## Execution Flow (main)

1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a registered user, I want to upload and archive my exported ChatGPT conversations and attachments so that I can search, manage, and retrieve past conversations securely.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given a signed-in user with an exported conversation file, when they upload the export, then the system stores the conversation metadata and attachments and returns a confirmation with a new Archive id.
2. Given a signed-in user viewing their archives, when they search by title, date, or content, then the system returns matching archives ordered by relevance and date.
3. Given a Clerk webhook delivery about a user lifecycle event, when the webhook is received and verified, then the system upserts the Clerk user profile into the database within an acceptable timeframe.

### Edge Cases

- Upload of malformed or unsupported export files ‚Äî system must surface a clear validation error and reject ingestion.
- Attachments too large or exceeding allowed total per archive ‚Äî system must reject upload and instruct the user on limits.
- Duplicate uploads of the same conversation export ‚Äî system should detect duplicates by checksum and prompt the user to either proceed with upload or link to the existing archive for improved user experience.
- Webhook verification failure (bad signature) ‚Äî webhook handler must return 401 and log the event for investigation.
- Partial failure during multi-file upload (some attachments saved, some fail) ‚Äî system should roll back the transaction or mark archive as partially ingested with clear remediation steps.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to sign up and sign in using a single, universal login flow through Clerk authentication only.
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept uploaded ChatGPT export files and persist archive metadata and attachments associated with the uploading user.
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate uploads (file format, size, and attachment types) and return actionable validation errors.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide CRUD operations for archives (create, read, update metadata, delete) accessible only to the owning user and authorized admins.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide search/filtering over a user's archives by title, content, date range, and attachment attributes.
- **FR-006**: System MUST store user identity and profile data synchronized from the auth provider when lifecycle webhooks arrive; synchronization must be idempotent.
- **FR-007**: System MUST verify webhook payloads using a timing-safe HMAC comparison and reject invalid signatures.
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist attachments using optimized file storage with secure read and write access controls.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide an admin dashboard to list users and archive counts with pagination and export capabilities.
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate all mutation inputs with a schema validation library and return structured error responses.

*Notes on testability:* each FR above maps to automated tests: auth flows, upload validation, webhook handler unit tests (including signature verification), CRUD integration tests, and search correctness tests.

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents a person with attributes: id (uuid), clerkId (string unique), email, firstName, lastName. Owned archives relationship.
- **Archive**: Represents an archived conversation: id (uuid), userId (fk), title, content (text), attachments (json array with metadata), createdAt, updatedAt.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- TypeScript strict mode for all source code.
- Server-first rendering with server components by default; client components only where user interactivity requires it. [IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL ‚Äî keep as an editorial preference, not an implementation constraint in the spec body if the audience is non-technical.]
- Security: timing-safe verification for webhooks; principle of least privilege for DB roles; sanitize and validate all inputs.
- Performance: webhook upsert should complete within 5 seconds under normal load (expected low throughput for individual user uploads).
- Data retention and backups: data persisted until user deletion (no automated retention policy required).
