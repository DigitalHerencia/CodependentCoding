# Implementation Plan: ChatGPT Archive Utility

**Branch**: `001-product-requirements-document` | **Date**: 2025-09-15 | **Spec**: D:\Monday\specs\001-product-requirements-document\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `D:\Monday\specs\001-product-requirements-document\spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

1. Load feature spec from Input path — OK
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION) — OK
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below — OK (no blocking violations)
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md — DONE
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md — DONE
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section — OK
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (placeholder tasks.md created)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command


## Summary
Build a secure web app to archive ChatGPT-exported conversations and attachments. Users upload exports, which the system validates, ingests, and stores as Archives linked to the user's account. Clerk manages auth and webhooks; Neon (Postgres) via Prisma stores user and archive metadata; attachments stored in S3-compatible storage.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Node) — inferred from Next.js recommendation
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (App Router), React, Prisma, Clerk, Tailwind, uploadthing or AWS SDK for S3 (NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Storage**: Neon Postgres via Prisma for metadata; S3-compatible object storage for attachments
**Testing**: Jest / vitest for unit/integration tests (NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Target Platform**: Vercel (serverless/edge constraints)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: Webhook upsert within 5s for normal load (NEEDS CLARIFICATION on expected throughput)
**Constraints**: Vercel serverless environment, Neon connection pooling considerations
**Scale/Scope**: MVP for single-tenant usage; plan for growth with queued webhook processing

## Constitution Check

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (web)
- Using framework directly: yes (Next.js App Router)
- Single data model: yes (User, Archive)

**Architecture**:
- Feature implemented within app, small libraries for cross-cutting concerns (prisma client, upload adapters)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- TDD encouraged: contract tests created first

**Observability**:
- Structured logging recommended during implementation

**Versioning**:
- Start at 0.1.0, increment build number on CI

## Project Structure
(see plan-template for folder examples). Default to web app structure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- research.md created; open items enumerated

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- data-model.md created
- contracts/api-openapi.yaml created
- quickstart.md created

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- tasks.md placeholder created; /tasks command will expand into prioritized TDD tasks

## Complexity Tracking
- No constitution violations requiring special justification were found.

## Progress Tracking
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning described (placeholder)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
