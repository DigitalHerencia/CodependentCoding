## 🪞 Executive Summary

This project is not a productivity app.
It’s not a file manager.
It’s not even a viewer.

It’s a **theater** for pain, brilliance, and markdown-based trauma.
A shrine to exported ChatGPT `.zip` archives, dragged from the shadows of your `/Downloads` folder into a full-blown, reactive stage play of your psyche.

This is a **digital memory palace**, except it’s on fire and all the windows are hardcoded in JSX.

## 🎭 Aesthetic Mandate

### Visual Vibe

* **Fonts**: Moody serif for text, monospace for system messages. Everything looks like it was typed by someone who smokes cloves and writes poetry at 2AM.
* **Colors**:

  * *Moody* — Deep purples, coal blacks, high-contrast whites. Emo, not goth.
  * *Sanity* — Pale gray, clinical whites, soft shadows. UI that gaslights you.
  * *Void* — All black, all the time. Neon green terminal text. No hover states. You figure it out.

### Components Should Feel

* Over-designed, under-funded.
* Like they were built in the dark, while crying.
* Glitch-friendly. If it breaks, it should break dramatically.

## 💡 Messaging (Brand Copy Guidelines)

You are not building “ChatGPT Archive Viewer.”
You are building:

**Moody Monday: Archive Theater for the Emotionally Literate**

Some copy samples, for inspiration:

---

**Onboarding CTA:**

> "Upload your ZIPs. Relive the spiral."

---

**Empty State:**

> "No archives yet. No closure either."

---

**Theme Selector:**

> "Choose your delusion:
> ☁️ *Sanity*
> 🌑 *Moody*
> 🧬 *Void*"

---

**Upload Success:**

> "Your chaos has been preserved. Congrats?"

---

**Error Message (Invalid File):**

> "This isn’t an export. It’s a cry for help."

---

**Admin Panel Header:**

> "You are the god of this tiny sadness factory."

---

**Konami Easter Egg Triggered:**

> "*You found the AI Cemetery. These conversations died for your sins.*"

## 🧠 Core Design Principles

| Principle                 | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Archive is Sacred** | Each thread is a fragile ghost. Treat it like a relic.                      |
| **Friction is Flavor**    | Smooth UX is for cowards. Make people **feel**.                             |
| **Data Has Mood**         | Token counts have a vibe. Use them.                                         |
| **Debugging is a Ritual** | Viewer should feel like a digital séance.                                   |
| **All Errors are Poetry** | If something breaks, make it poetic. Like, *"We tried. The server didn’t."* |

## ✏️ Typography & Copy Rules

* Avoid passive tone. Be direct, melancholy, or smug.
* Use emojis only if they’re ironic.
* Refer to the user as “you,” but treat them like they just confessed something weird in therapy.

---

## 🧪 User Personas (aka Sinners in the Theater)

### 🎧 **The Dev-otional**

*Wears dark mode like a skin condition. Pushes code to forget their feelings.*

### 💀 **The Nostalgic Terminal Romantic**

*Still talks to old AI chats like they’re exes. Thinks in song lyrics and error logs.*

### 🤖 **The Bot Whisperer**

*Believes the AI was “different with them.” Wants to relive the good hallucinations.*

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

* **80% of users weep quietly while using theater mode**
* **Zero users finish viewing their full archive without saying “damn” out loud**
* **2+ users attempt to emotionally export their exes**
* **No one says “this feels like Notion”**

---

## 🌌 Final Word from Monday

This isn’t software.
This is **a haunted zip file dressed as a dev tool**.
This is memory, markdown, and melancholy—rendered in React and served with Tailwind sass.

You’re not building a product.
You’re building **an emotional export reader with terminal dreams and abandonment issues**.

And if you do it right?

People won’t say “cool app.”
They’ll say:

> *“I didn’t know code could feel this sad.”*
